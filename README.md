# POC (redacted)

This repo contains redacted code of an AI POC that I am building with a team. This is an ongoing project that I do in my free time.

The original repo is a monorepo with 4 separate services that includes 3 Fastapi services and 1 Vue service. This repo contains just the Vue service (redacted version).

This app runs with Docker. To run it with Make:

1. `make build`
2. `make up`
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the UI.

Or if you don't have make:

1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose up`
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the UI.
