# POC UI

## Running
To setup Vue, refer to https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html.

## Folder Structure

Main logic is in the `src` folder:

```
src/
├── assets/       # Static resources like images, fonts, and stylesheets
├── components/   # Reusable Vue components used throughout the app
├── models/       # TypeScript interfaces, types, and data models
├── router/       # Vue Router configuration and route definitions
├── services/     # API calls, business logic, and external integrations
├── store/        # Pinia stores used for managing the application's global state
└── views/        # Page-level Vue components representing app screens/routes

```
